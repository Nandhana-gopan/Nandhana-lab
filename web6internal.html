            <p id="abc">. When you enter a URL or click a link in your browser, that browser sends a request via HTTP or HTTPS to the web server. The server then processes the request—fetching the appropriate files or generating content dynamically—and sends back the response. The web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge) receives this response and renders the content visually, allowing you to navigate the web, interact with pages, click buttons, fill in forms, and more</p>
